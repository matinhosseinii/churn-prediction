# Churn Prediction

> ⚠️ Work in progress — not ready

This project aims to build a **customer churn prediction pipeline**.  
The instructions below will help set up the environment to run the project locally. but as the project isn't completed yet, they are currently just a set of personal notes.


1. install miniconda
2. run `make venv-init`
3. run `conda activate ./venv`
4. pip install -e .
5. run `make check-tf` to check if the tensorflow is working right and if there is a gpu available or not.
